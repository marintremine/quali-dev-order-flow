# Practical work Exercise 3: Enable team collaboration

The goal of this exercise is to enable team collaboration in the order flow application. You will have to set up the development environment and the tools to facilitate collaboration between team members and cross-team communication.

The technical stack based on Gradle, Quarkus and Docker is already set up.

**estimated time**: 30 minutes

**difficulty**: beginner

## Task 1: Choose a version control pattern and branching strategy

To facilitate collaboration between team members, you must choose a version control pattern. Using your knowledge of version control systems, you must choose a pattern that will allow you to work together on the same codebase among 2 teams.

## Task 2: Define teams responsibilities

To facilitate collaboration between team members, you must define the responsibilities of each team. To achieve this, help yourself with application responsibilities and the microservices architecture.

## Task 3: README and collaboration rules

To facilitate collaboration between team members, you must define the rules of collaboration. You must complete the existing README file if necessary and write a CONTRIBUTING.md file that will explain how to work together and how to communicate between teams.

::: tip
You can use [Readme.so](https://readme.so/) to generate a markdown files.

## Task 4: Split your group into 2 teams

Split your group into 2 teams and assign the responsibilities of each team. You must define the roles of each team member and the communication channels between teams (Trello, Mail, Slack, etc.).

::: tip
Further exercises will require you to do the exercises in teams.
You can leverage IDE collaboration tools like Live Share in Visual Studio Code to work together.
